# Huffman_Encoding-Decoding
Advanced Data structures - Course project


-------
Create huffman tree using the following data structures as the priority queue
1. Binary min heap
2. 4-way cache optimized min heap
3. Pairing heap

Measure the time taken to create the huffman tree using each of the above priority queues and find out the fastest DS.

Use this DS to create the Huffman Tree, encode the input file containing integers (0 to 999,999), and decode the encoded file.
